Guide to the Raspberry Pi powered by Fedora Linux
=================================================
This guide will be updated, hopefully frequently. As you will see, there are two versions of the documentaion here.

+ Rough notes version
+ Chapter version with each chapter self-contained and more wholistic.

The notes version is available [here] (https://raspberry-pi-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

The chapters will be available as I finish work on them:

+ [Chapter 1] (https://github.com/amitsaha/raspi-guide/blob/master/chap1/raspi_1.rst)
