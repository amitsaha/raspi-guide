Exploring the Raspberry Pi with Fedora Linux
============================================

You have been using Linux on your big computers so far and want a light
reading about exploring the Raspberry Pi? Or, you are just learning
Linux with the Raspberry Pi?  

Hop on. This guide is for you. Remeber this guide is under construction
in every way.

This guide is aimed at wannabe power users of the Raspberry Pi. You
won't even see the window manager or the GUI if you follow this guide. All work is
performed on the Pi in a headless manner - you ssh into your Pi. If that
puts you off, you are better off fetching any of the other guides.
